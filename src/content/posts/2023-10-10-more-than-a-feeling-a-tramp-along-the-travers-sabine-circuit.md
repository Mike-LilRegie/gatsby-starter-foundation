# The lead up

"I'm thinking of hiking the Traverse-Sabine next holidays if anyone's keen. Sometime late September to early October." messaged Mark, and having recently done an overnight trip in the Tararuas and therefore totally in shape, I was in. It wasn't an area I'd tramped in before, so I was keen to see if it lived up to the hype. We'd be joined by Steve, an old friend of Mark's.

Having not bought any gear for a while, I immediately went out and bought a dehydrator and started going down the rabbit-hole of DIY dehydrating. For the trip I dehydrated both full meals - bolognese and vegetarian chilli - and various fruits, vegetables, pasta and mince which I combined into meals. Yes, you dehydrate cooked pasta - it means that you just need to rehydrate again, no need to cook it on the trip.

The weather in the week prior to the trip wasn't great and we debated the gear we'd need, essentially ice axes and micro-spikes. Thank you Dom for the ice axe - it was needed, albeit briefly. However, things looked to be on the improve for the week of the trip and on Sunday I arrived at the airport ready to take the very small Sounds Air plane with the very young pilot across to Nelson. Just about to walk into the terminal, I turned back to the car just as Deb was jumping out of the driver's seat.

Deb: "You walked away with the car keys!"
Me: "I left my raincoat at home!"

It's a good thing we live close by. 

All trips should start with being met at the airport in a gold Mercedes.

The drive from Nelson to St Arnaud of course included a stop for a pie along the way. Steve has a bach there so we dropped our gear, went for a little walk to the lake and then to the Alpine Lodge for a couple of pre-trip beers. The forecast was wet and cold for Monday, but clearing after that.

# Day 1 - to Lakehead hut
Packs were packed. And compared. Steve had the heaviest pack and the most food. Mark had the oldest pack - his Father's wooden H-framed canvas pack. No hip-belts to relieve the loads on these. I had the lightest, most colourful and most expensive pack. A big breakfast at the Alpine Lodge and we were ready to leave the top Mt Robert carpark just after 9am. The skies were dark and lowering. The first rumble of thunder happened about 20 minutes in. It started raining soon after that.

![Mark in the rain](/assets/img_4520-2.jpg "Mark regrets some of his life choices")

The plan was to lunch at Coldwater hut and then head onto John Tait hut for the night. Coldwater hut was cold. It had been raining since we left. Mark was wet. Mark was cold. Mark also had a cold. The thought of another 5 hours to John Tait hut was not appealing. Coldwater hut, with the stone floor and no firewood and the wind whipping off the lake was not appealing. Mark was coughing and spluttering. Caught between a stone floor and a cold wet trek, Steve had the frankly brilliant idea of sidestepping 50 minutes across the river to Lakehead hut - much nicer, firewood, dry. It meant a change of plans, and Mark put up some token resistance, but a couple hours later, we were warm, dry and looking at the weather coming down the Travers valley.

So, did I mention I have a very expensive, very lightweight pack? It leaks. Three hours walking in the rain and the back panel was soaked and there was a puddle of water in the bottom of the pack. I was not entirely happy. Photos were taken and emails have subsequently been sent.

# Day 2 - to Upper Travers hut

The day dawned clear, calm and cold, with a dusting of fresh snow on the hills. It was to be the first of four days in a row of glorious weather. The walk up the Travers valley is just stunning. Easy walking, little bubbling side streams, mountains coming into view. As Mark and I kept mentioning, the Tararuas it is not!

We had a late lunch at John Tait hut before the final push to Upper Travers. Arriving there, a little before dusk, in the cool calm, with a ring of mountains around us was magic. I'll admit to being pretty tired by that stage, but also to wanting to be nowhere else.

On 1 October, the day before we started our tramp, DOC switched rules over for hut passes. No longer were annual hut passes valid, but you needed to buy a $25 serviced hut pass for each of the Nelson Lakes huts. Having possibly misread the DOC website, I'd purchased an annual hut pass a couple of days before we left. ( Yes, this was also an act of faith in my body holding out! ) Mark had done the same. Steve, bless him, informed us on the Friday before leaving of the new rules. I decided to just go with what I had, whereas Mark went into the Nelson DOC office to try and refund his annual pass and buy hut tickets. He left with both the pass and new hut tickets. DOC 1 - Mark 0. He was not happy to find no firewood at Upper Travers hut and in a "rage against the machine" moment, did not use his hut pass that night.

# Day 3 - to West Sabine hut

There were four keas waking us up in the morning!

![Kea](/assets/img_4559.jpg "The world's only mountain parrot!")

We had intended to have been at West Sabine hut by now, and to have had a short day to Blue Lake hut. As we were behind schedule, the plan was to get to Blue Lake hut today. The walk up to Travers Saddle was why you do these trips.

![Mark, walking up from Upper Travers hut](/assets/img_4563-2.jpg "Mark, walking up from Upper Travers hut")

It's so long since I've been in the South Island mountains like this, it was all I could do not to just sit down and take in the scenery for an hour. The final approach up towards Travers Saddle steepened, with snow. We were following the footsteps of someone who'd gone through the previous day, but later in the day and their footprints had sunk deeper into the softer snow. We decided to don micro-spikes, break out the ice-axes, and cut some steps up the final steep pitch. Well, Mark and I did. Steve, wearing boots and not trail shoes, let us do the hard work and just clomped on up behind us.

No wind on Travers saddle. Views all around. Fresh snow. What more could you ask for?

![Mt Travers](/assets/img_4571-2.jpg "Mt Travers")

Less snow on the other side, but glorious long views down the East Sabine river.

![Mark, looking down to the Sabine river](/assets/img_4575-2.jpg "Mark's new Tinder profile photo")

It's a long descent down to the East Sabine river. I went down slowly and carefully, tending to my knees and found Mark at the bottom, lying back on the soft grass in a sunny spot, having a cup of tea. He'd been there a while. Steve arrived a while later and I was very appreciative of the rest it allowed me. Mark was still coughing and suffering from his cold and at times meant we could almost keep up with him. I made the mistake of trying to sympathise and saying it must be tough going to do all of this with the cold. Mark responded, "To be honest Mike, I'm not going fast enough to notice it." Ouch!

I arrived at West Sabine hut sometime around 2pm. My first words to Mark were, "I'm not going any fucking further today!". And that was Blue Lake hut crossed off the itinerary. There were two hunters in the hut already and this is a story worth telling.

It was a father and son. The son was 59 and the father 83. They had set off the day before around midday from Sabine hut for the - DOC timed - 5 hour trip to West Sabine. They had a boat which they've left at the Sabine hut jetty. The son said he usually took around the DOC time for a trip, so didn't think anything of leaving his Dad behind after about 6 hours so as to get to the (presumed nearby) hut and get the fire going and dinner on etc. When his Dad hadn't arrived by a little after 8pm, he went back along the track till he found him, took his pack and then both arrived at West Sabine around 11pm. So 11 hours for the 5 hour walk. They were having a rest day when we arrived. Understandably.

The first thing we noticed was an explosion of dehydrated food packets spread out on the bunk. The son said he was trying to get to grips with dehy food and what was needed. They had 8 main meals and various desserts and such between them. The two of them. For a 3 night trip. That was the dehy food. They also had fresh steaks, and bacon, and eggs, and meat patties. The latter of which they gave to us, so we had a pre-dinner snack. They had a goddamn bag of potatoes! They had two cookers and various pots and pans. The son carried a rifle. Just in case they saw something. Somehow we got around to asking the son how heavy his pack was. Reader, it was 35kg! On seeing our look of astonishment, he was quick to point out that one reason it was so heavy was that they were carrying 10 litres of bottled water between them. 10 litres! For a supposed 5 hour trip! Beside a river! With lots of lovely side streams along the way! They weren't sure it was safe to drink the water along the way.

We had a great time and conversations hanging out with them that night! Everything aside, I'll be very happy to be still tramping at 83.

# Day 4 - to Sabine hut

The plan was to make it to Speargrass hut and so leave us with a very easy walk out on the final day, and time for wine, women and song at the Alpine Lodge.

Plans, amirite? I'd hoped, every morning on waking up and getting underway, that my legs would have gotten stronger and found their true tramping rhythm. Spoiler: they did not. Mark, sometime on the final day, "I'll be honest Mike, you were both getting slower each day." He values honesty, does Mark!

Twenty minutes into the day and Mark catches me and says, "How about, instead of going to Speargrass, we head up the Mt Cedric track from Sabine hut, and get to Angelus for the night. Then head out along Robert Ridge." I told him I'd take the suggestion under advisement. \
\[ Editor's note: At Sabine hut, there's a sign that says, basically, "the Mt Cedric track is very steep, takes about 6 hours, oh, and there's no water sources along the way." ]

Forty minutes into the day and I told Mark he could fuck off with his Mt Cedric track idea and do it by himself if he wanted. Steve and I would not be partaking.

It's actually a lovely track down the Sabine river.

![Track, heading down the Sabine river.](/assets/img_4582-2.jpg "Track, heading down the Sabine river")

Steve and I arrived after about 5 hours. Mark was drinking a cup of tea. Having told him Mt Cedric was not happening, we looked at how far it was to Speargrass hut. Another 5 hours. "Fuck you, Mark. We're not doing that either!" We spent the rest of the day enjoying the sunshine, sandflies and stunning lake views at Sabine hut.

# Day 5 - out to Mt Robert carpark

We a final 9 hour day beckoning, we were out the door at 7am on a lovely cool calm morning.

There's a steady climb from Lake Rotoroa, then a long sidle around to Speargrass hut. I was... getting slower. Steve asked me a couple of times where I was hurting. "Everywhere!" But, as always on this trip, the bush and trail were just lovely.

For 4 1/2 days of the tramp I'd had an earworm. I've been listening a lot to a wonderful album by this country singer - don't worry, she's quite obscure, you won't have heard of her - and snippets of the songs from the album had been in my head. Constantly. Every step. When I tried to sleep at night. On waking up. It's a sign of a great album but also, gimme me a break! I was walking along on the final day, tired, sore, head full of these incessant songs, and then suddenly... like the sun breaking through the clouds; like manna from heaven; like the hallelujah fucking chorus... the song "More Than A Feeling" by Boston, came into my head and swept everything else away. This song is a classic 70's banger and officially the best song in the world.

Speargrass hut in 5 hours for a lunch stop. Then the final 3 hour walk out. Halfway along this, Mark finally snapped as Steve called for a rest stop. "I'll see you down the track", said Mark, striding off. Spoiler: we didn't. We'd been passed earlier by a young French guy who left Speargrass hut a little after us. I think someone's pride was hurt. The French guy never stood a chance. Apparently he told Mark, who was waiting at the carpark, "You walk very fast! I couldn't keep up."

It was a wonderful trip! Thank you Mark and Steve!

I think right it was right on the edge of what I can do at the moment, but my knees seem to be ok, and 3 days later I'm almost walking normally. What doesn't break us, only makes us stronger! Great company. Beautiful track. Would do again!
